Final project (largely up to you):

Create a program that designs, uses, and demonstrates understanding of the following:
1. variables, conditionals, loops, and collections
2. code organization (formatting, identifiers, placement of definitions)
3. code decomposition (functions, classes, methods, and modules),
4. an understanding of design (hierarchy)
5. an understanding of testing (test your methods and attributes, maybe have a whole automated example!)
6. user IO, file IO, and input validation,
7. recursion,
8. GUI components and event driven programming,
9. exceptions,
10. Inheritance.

<strong>Create a document that shows both an image of your program demonstrating the above topic and an image of some source code that makes that example work.<strong>
